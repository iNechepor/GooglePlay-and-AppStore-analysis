The only thing which is clear is that the more rewiews the more valuable and concious data inhereted in Rating. I have my doubts about this approach, cause we targeting on englishspeaking audience. For example Instagram can be used in local language, and if duplicate app data segrigated by geography, than we take into account irrelevant data, cause I can assume, that there are more asian people using this app, as there are simply more people who lives in Asia.

This might be intermediate step to move further and find out how many users each genre attracts.\n",

For AppStore dataset we can use `rating_count_tot` as proxy to find out amount of users. It is not accurate figure, but as we use it in scope of one dataset to compare data within AppStore - we can presume that percentage of users tend to leave app rating is the same for every app in data set. This approach will anihilate error within dataset, but we can not compare figures between IOs and android apps. Comparison posible only between parts and percentages.\n",

    "First assesment shows that apps with largest amount of apps are the onec easy to develop and probably market already filed with other mighty companies. First five is: Navigation, Reference, Social Networking, Music, Weather. For our company the success recepie is to find genre with large user amount, market not floded with similar apps, and there is no need for other infrostructure for app to work (we are not going to employ large amount of finantial analitics to make Finance app). I would recomend to develop `Photo&Video`, `Food&Drinks`, `Book` apps for AppStore market. Those apps are in top 10 averege users list and there are not so much of those on market. The only exception is Photo and Video, those apps are popular and there is no lack on market, but those seem to be on boarder with Social Network apps. If our developers will find way to integrate apps with social networks it will widely expand amount of users. \n",

It might be interesting for our team, cause at the moment huge amount of content generated and if we are able to transfer user from real world to imagery using masks or backgrounds it could be profitable. It is in top 5 of list `average amount of users`, but we will get quite some chalandge with other apps.\n",
